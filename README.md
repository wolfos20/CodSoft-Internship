Project Overview

Task 1 :  Iris Data Classification
This project focuses on classifying the Iris flower dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset Description
The dataset is available in CSV format with the following structure:

SepalLengthCm: Sepal length in centimeters.
SepalWidthCm: Sepal width in centimeters.
PetalLengthCm: Petal length in centimeters.
PetalWidthCm: Petal width in centimeters.
Species: The species of the Iris flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)



Task 2 : Unemployment analysis with Python
This project aims to analyze unemployment data using Python to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. By utilizing data analysis and visualization techniques, we can better understand the factors affecting unemployment rates and how they vary across different regions and demographics.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis typically includes the following features:

Date: The time period for the unemployment data.
Region: The geographical area (e.g., country, state, city) the data pertains to.
Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
Other Demographic Data: Information such as age, gender, industry, education level, etc.


Task-5: SALES PREDICTION 
This project aims to predict sales using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we can build models that forecast future sales, helping businesses make informed decisions. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project typically includes the following features:

Date: The time period for the sales data.
Store: Identifier for the store.
Item: Identifier for the item.
Sales: Number of items sold.
Other Features: Additional information such as promotions, holidays, store location, etc.
